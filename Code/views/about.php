<p>
  Named after a regiment of the British army with which the CEO and Dean was associated as an exchange officer, KOI adopts a similar spirit and values with traditions and an established reputation for its recognised development of successful leaders.
</p>

<p>
  The initials "KOI" also symbolize the koi fish, known in some Asian cultures for its perseverance and strength. According to legend, a koi that succeeds in climbing the falls at Dragon Gate on the Yellow River transforms into a dragon, representing courage and the ability to attain high goals.
